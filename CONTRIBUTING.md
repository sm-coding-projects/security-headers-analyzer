# Contributing to Security Headers Analyzer

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Security Headers Analyzer as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint)
* Write meaningful commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Testing

* Write tests for new features and bug fixes
* Maintain code coverage above 80%
* Use Jest and React Testing Library for component tests
* Use Playwright for E2E tests

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/security-headers-analyzer/issues).

### Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Possible implementation approach
- Any alternatives considered
